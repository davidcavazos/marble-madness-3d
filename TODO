+ Viewport & Occlusion Culling (BulletPhysics DbvtCullingDemo)
~ Add more primitives (sphere, cilinder, cone, torus, etc)
~ Save input commands as a replay script
~ Read/write scene from XML
- Make input manager into a vector, only one can be active at a time (XML)
- Binding keys (or other inputs) with a command
- Possibility of multiple active cameras in different viewports

High scores
Credits

Level file format:
list of used entities
description of the heightmap
scene graph with all entities

Entity file format:
list of all assets with file paths
list of all components

Design:
// Init all managers
FileManager()
ResourceManager(fileManager)
DeviceManager(SDL_OPENGL) // window, input system, render driver (OpenGL)
RenderManager(device) // list with renderable entities and render implementation
GuiManager(renderer, resources)
AudioManager(resources)
PhysicsManager()
SceneManager()

// On a new state
each state will be saved in a "level" xml file
load necessary assets if not loaded
